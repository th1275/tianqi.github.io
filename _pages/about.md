About Me
======

I am a 5th year Ph.D. student from the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Meng Wang. I received Master’s degree in Constrol Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology and Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Harbin Engineering Unicersity in 2018 and 2016, respectively. In Spring 2022, I interned with the Argonne National Laboratory, mentored by Dr. Dongbo Zhao and Dr. Tianqi Hong. My current research focuses on the theory and applications of Reinforcement Learning and Optimization.

About Me
======

I am a postdoc fellow at the Umich, where I focused on the energy justice and the electrification of energy systems. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Parth Vaishnav and I am also co-advisord by Prof. Michael Craig, Prof. Johanna Mathieu and Prof. Carina Gronlund. I obtained my Ph.D. degree on 2022 from the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Meng Wang. In Spring 2022, I interned at the Argonne National Laboratory, mentored by Dr. Dongbo Zhao and Dr. Tianqi Hong. I received Master’s degree in Constrol Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology and Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Harbin Engineering Unicersity in 2018 and 2016, respectively. My current research focuses on the machine Learning, high-dimensional energy data analytics, renewable energy and power system monitoring.
